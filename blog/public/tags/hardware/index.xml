      <description>Part one, hardware.
My computing history begins with me pestering my parents until they got me a computer. I didn&amp;rsquo;t know what hardware was out there, but I knew I needed a computer.
My first computer was the Tandy Color Computer 2.

This computer was affectionaly dubbed the CoCo by its adherents elsewhere, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t learn this nickname until much later. LAter, I also learned that there were many computers with the TRS-80 moniker, spanning at least 3 processor families.</description>
