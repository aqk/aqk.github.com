Part one, hardware.


// the feeling of reaching out -- modem

My computing history begins with me pestering my parents until they got me a computer. I didn't know what hardware existed, but I knew I needed a computer.

My first computer was the [Tandy Color Computer 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRS-80_Color_Computer#Color_Computer_2_(1983%E2%80%931986)).

This computer was affectionaly dubbed the [CoCo](http://www.trs-80.org/color-computer-1/#note1) by its adherents elsewhere, but I didn't learn this nickname until much later. I would also learn that there were many computers with the TRS-80 moniker, spanning at least 3 processor families. I may cover these another time.

The 6809 was in many ways more powerful than the 6502 in more popular computers like the C64. Compatibility, cost, and being in-between the capabilities of the already well-known 6502 and upcoming 8008 probably limited it

https://retrocomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/5767/what-limited-the-use-of-the-6809-cpu-in-personal-computers

Mainly, though, not many companies had the money or design expertise to make a computer, and the 6809 never made it into a computer as popular as the C65.

Another interesting difference between the CoCo and the C64 is the C64's daughter chips, or coprocessors - the VICC-II and SID.

This distinction would be used to even more impressive effect in the Amiga even more impre




I didn't get to learn about the internals of the machine until

It had a whopping 64K RAM, a weird Black-on-green display, and I loved it.
I learned a lot from that computer. [[the computesrs i own now are more powerful, but there are ways in which they are less satisfying. when you turned on this kind of computer, it was instantly responsive. You would press a button, hear a relay click

If you didn't have an (expensive!) external disk drive, permanant storage was on tape cassette. This form of storage wasn't very robust, so I used a pen and paper for program storage. When my programs got too long, I took a hiatus from programming for a while.

Other computers in my home town around that time were the [C64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64), C128, the [Timex Sinclair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timex_Sinclair_1000#ts1500), the [TI-99/4A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Instruments_TI-99/4A), the [Amiga 500](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga_500), and eventually, the [IBM XT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Personal_Computer_XT). That bad boy had 2(!) floppy disks. The possibilities were endless. Well, except the graphical possibilities. (link) The Amiga would hold onto the title of best home computer graphics for many years yet.

The one that got away: [The Laser 128](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_128)

After I was good enough at using the computer to want to write larger programs, I began another campaign for a computer, this time with reliable storage. My parents knew it was important to me, and really did everything they could.

My mom took me to the nearest large city to hunt down one of these machines. I was very shy in some ways at that point in my childhood, and I was afraid to talk to the stores on the phone. We returned from that trip without a Laser 128.

If I had to pick just one of them for my younger self today, knowing that there would be little chance to get manuals, I'd got iwth the amiga or xt. xxx The even though the BASIC machines had an easier learning curve.

The feature that separates those two machines is that they had reliable external storage (the configurations that were available to me).

This ability to share information was a powerful factor in the eventual explosion of the home computer market before good networks became ubiquitous.

# Late high-school

At my next school, I encountered the [Apple //e](https://apple-history.com/aiiee), and on it [Zork](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNN4VPlRBJ8), and [Logo](https://turtleacademy.com/program/40499). And also my first [flowchart template](https://www.amazon.com/Rapidesign-Computer-Flowchart-Template-R54/dp/B000GOWAGM).

A flowchart stencil may seem archaic now, but I believe that diagramming is still an important tool for communicating. Just not for documenting your entire program.

A little later, one of my old school friends got an Apple IIgs. This computer bridged the capability gap between the Apple II, and the macintosh.

Later, I had a job that allowed me to borrow an unused [286](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_80286). Such power! It could run architectural software. And of course, [Commander Keen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQVk6wmaqAs).

Novel Netware

Looking back on what I've written here, I'm surprised that there were so many apple computers in my computing?? upbringing formative years. Then, as now, they were expensize (iigs/mac). I always encountered them in schools. 2019 dollars

# College

The college I attended had many models of macs. I think Apple had a large educational discount program at the time.

The two [LC](https://apple-history.com/lc)'s in the computer lab had greyscale monitors, which made them less desirable to some, but their unique portrait orientation made them ideal for programming. The greyscale seemed easier on the eyes than some other, brighter monitors.

The school was connected to the outside world over a single [T1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-carrier) - roughly 1.5 Mbits/second.

Time passed. Our school bought an RS/6000. One interesting thing about this computer was that it had a red, 3-digit display on the front panel that would display an error code is something went *REALLY* wrong. The most popular number was "888".

An unusual alliance between Apple, IBM, and Motorola produced the [PowerPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerPC)

The background:
Desires: Apple wanted multiple vendors for their supply chain, and a more advanced processor.

The environment: MS/Intel was rapidly swallowing everything.

In the annals of confusing computer branding/marketing, the PowerPC names are relatively tame

This thing was fantastic. I immediately wrote a few programs to bridge this device to xxx services, over email.

So, if I needed directions, I could send an email with a special prefix, then a shortened command like:

map "address 1" to "address 2"

xxx would convert that into a URL like http://mapquest.com/directions?from="address 1"&to="addres 2"
read the result, page scrape that, and send me an email with the step by step directions.

Around 1999, I was working in streaming media. The specs we targeted were a pentium II running at 200MHz. One of our products was a re-broadcasting server. Our objective was to saturate the common networking technology of the time, 10BaseT.
